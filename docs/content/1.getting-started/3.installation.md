## Local development

::steps
### Create your docs directory

Use the `docus` CLI to create a new Docus project in the `docs/` directory:

```bash [Terminal]
npx docus init docs
```

We recommend using the `npm` package manager.

### Start your docs server in development

Move to the `docs/` directory and start your docs server in development mode:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at <http://localhost:4000>

### Write your documentation

Head over the [Edition](https://docus.dev/concepts/edition) section to learn how to write your documentation.
